# 2025’s Biggest Data Center Construction Stories: A Year in Review


The 2025 data center construction boom revealed both the scale and the strain of the digital infrastructure industry’s future.

December 18, 2025

2025 was another year of rapid expansion for the data center industry, albeit with some growing pains. AI, cloud computing, and record investment pushed physical and policy limits alike, from energy supply to land use and regulation.

Our most-read stories of the year capture this tension: ambitious projects, such as the $500 billion Stargate initiative, promised to reshape global infrastructure, while others revealed the literal weight of AI workloads, the strain on power grids, and the mounting costs of cooling and water use.

Zoning barriers, trade policies, and construction forecasts underscore how geopolitics and local governance now shape digital expansion as much as technology itself. Meanwhile, architects turned to AI to design the next generation of data centers. Together, these stories trace a pivotal year of speed, scale, and visibility for the data center industry.

Our top 10 data center construction stories of 2025 capture a year of AI-fueled growth, power shortages, and rapid innovation. Developers faced mounting energy and zoning challenges while exploring new designs, cleaner power sources, and smarter build strategies to keep pace with demand.

This article highlights deals, investments, and expert perspectives on how hyperscalers and energy companies are positioning SMRs to deliver reliable, low-carbon baseload power, even as permitting timelines and technical integration pose hurdles.

Despite none being operational in the US yet, planned deployments as early as 2027, along with the strategic importance of clean energy for AI-driven workloads, are driving serious discussion across the sector and posing questions about how emerging nuclear options could reshape the long-term power landscape for digital infrastructure.


## 3.Heavy Compute: AI Data Centers Have a Weight Problem


Amid the industry’s scramble to support AI workloads, a less discussed but increasingly critical challenge weighs on data center builders: AI compute equipment is very heavy.

AI server racks can far exceed the weight of traditional gear, prompting designers to rethink raised floors, structural supports, and even the viability of multi-story facilities to safely and cost-effectively host this denser hardware.

Experts explain how this shift is forcing a move toward slab-on-grade construction and single-story layouts, as well as more rigorous assessments of existing buildings being repurposed for AI infrastructure.

## 4.Opening the Stargate: Tech Giants to Invest $500B in AI Data Center Infrastructure


Data Center KnowledgeSenior Editor James Walker writes about the ambitious Stargate Project, in which tech heavyweights such as OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle have pledged up to $500 billion to build a new generation of AI-ready data centers across the US.

Framed as a moonshot for digital infrastructure, Stargate promises up to 20 facilities designed to power the world’s most advanced AI models, but questions linger about how quickly that kind of capacity can come online.

The announcement drew big headlines and bigger speculation, as the industry debated whether such massive investment could really keep pace with the breakneck speed of AI innovation.


## 5.Land Barriers: How Zoning Regulations Could Stall Data Center Industry Expansion


Zoning regulations are emerging as a critical, if sometimes underappreciated, barrier to data center expansion as demand for capacity driven by AI and cloud workloads surges.

Because many local land-use codes neither explicitly allow nor clearly prohibit data centers, projects can become entangled in ambiguous rules, lengthy approvals, and community pushbacks that slow or even derail development.

Efforts to clarify or modernize zoning for data centers have faced resistance in places like Missouri and northern Virginia, illustrating how land-use politics can shape where, and whether, new facilities get built.

## 6.Architecture Firm Unveils First Data Center Designed Entirely by AI


Cove Architecture utilized an agentic AI platform to produce what could be the first data center design entirely created by AI. AI successfully completed a 10,000 sq.ft blueprint for a facility in Colorado in approximately 30 days – a process that traditionally takes months.

The AI-driven design incorporated sustainability features, including a solar array projected to offset a significant portion of energy use, smart water reuse systems, and agrivoltaic optimization, demonstrating how machine intelligence can accelerate and refine complex planning tasks.

Industry experts cited in the piece note that while human oversight remains essential, AI tools are rapidly reshaping workflows, from zoning and regulatory analysis to performance modeling.


## 7.AI Cooling Demands Push Data Center into Deep Water


Rising AI workloads are driving up data center water consumption, particularly for cooling systems that use water to manage the intense heat generated by dense compute hardware.

Data Center Knowledgecontributor Nathan Eddy highlights that water scarcity in key markets is becoming a credit and operational risk for hyperscale data center operators, particularly in areas where local resources are strained, and regulators and investors are paying closer attention.

Operators are adapting with more water-efficient designs and alternative cooling technologies, but water remains a critical constraint alongside power availability in site selection and risk planning.


## 8.Data Center Construction Boom: 10 GW of New Capacity Set for 2025


Published at the beginning of the year, this forecast by JLL predicted that roughly 10 GW of new data center capacity would break ground worldwide. It also noted that about 7 GW of projects were expected to be completed during the year, including more than 3 GW in North America, signaling a notably active construction cycle.

While these predictions were directionally accurate, signaling demand and intent for more data centers, only about 7 GW of capacity was actually delivered within the year.


## 9.Trump, Tariffs, and Data Centers: Uncertainty Reigns – For Now


Trump’s US tariff announcements introduced uncertainty into the data center sector in 2025, prompting concerns about higher construction costs and potential supply chain slowdowns.

Proposed levies on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China threatened to increase prices for key materials and equipment, prompting some developers to reassess their project budgets and timelines.

The tariffs served as a reminder of how shifts in trade policy can quickly impact infrastructure planning and cost forecasts across the industry.


## 10.Power Availability Now Drives Data Center Site Selection


Power availability has become the dominant factor in data center site selection, surpassing traditional considerations such as proximity to metropolitan areas, as developers seek reliable electricity for increasingly large AI workloads.

With grid capacity tight in many established markets, operators are seeking non-traditional locations with abundant power or alternatives, such as onsite generation, to meet demand.

Data Center Knowledgecontributor Drew Robb reports how energy constraints are reshaping where and how data centers are built as the industry confronts real-world limits on grid capacity and transmission infrastructure.
