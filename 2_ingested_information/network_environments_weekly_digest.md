U.S. data-center construction news digest (Dec 30 – Jan 6)

Below are the latest U.S. data-center construction and expansion news including the project developer, location and scale, known investment and timeline details, the current project status, and key notes.

*Status categories: In planning indicates the project is at an early stage (land purchase, rezoning, or community consultation) with no construction start; Under development signals that contracts have been awarded or construction has begun.

## Summary of Trends and Observations

- **Power & cooling innovations:** GridFree AI's Power Foundry model uses natural-gas-powered, grid-independent infrastructure and chilled-water cooling to deliver >1.5 GW per site. This approach promises faster deployment (<24 months) and resilience against grid constraints.

- **Mega-campus planning vs. community resistance:** Prologis' 576-acre Shelbyville proposal and the 202-acre Project Tango in Florida illustrate the tension between large-scale developments and local concerns over water use, noise and community impact. In both cases, petitions and public hearings are shaping outcomes.

- **Continued government investment:** The U.S. Army's $171.5M contract to convert facilities into a data center in Huntsville shows federal agencies are investing in critical computing infrastructure.

- **AI-driven expansion:** xAI's acquisition of another Memphis building and claim of nearly 2 GW of compute capacity signals the escalating arms race for AI compute power. Developers continue to acquire buildings and land to support AI workloads, even before construction details are finalized.

- **Growing pipeline across states:** Proposals span the Midwest (Indiana), South (Texas, Florida) and Missouri, reflecting the geographic diversification of hyperscale projects. Many rely on rezoning farmland or woodlands, prompting debates over land use and environmental impact.
