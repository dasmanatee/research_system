## North American Data Center Deals

Amid news that AI workloads are expected to dominate data center buildouts within the next two years, this past month saw several high-profile data center announcements in the US.

AI powerhouse Anthropic unveiled a $50 billion plan to build US data centers with UK-based cloud partner Fluidstack, starting with projects in New York and Texas. The companies said additional sites in the US are expected to follow and the project will create 800 permanent jobs and 2,000 construction roles.

Meanwhile, Google and Westinghouse have joined forces to optimize the construction and operation of 10 planned nuclear reactors slated to begin construction in 2030. The companies said they have been working for months on a plan that boosts normally sluggish nuclear reactor construction timelines with a custom AI-driven Google Cloud optimization platform.

Meta is eyeing a steady stream of power by wading into the complex world of electricity trading, betting it can accelerate the construction of new US power plants that are vital to its AI ambitions. The decision comes after Meta heard from investors and plant developers that too few power buyers were willing to make the early, long-term commitments required to spur investment.

In Wisconsin, the Facebook parent company is set to spend more than $1 billion to build an AI data center. The 700,000 sq.ft facility will be constructed in Beaver Dam, a small city north of Madison and Milwaukee.

Elsewhere in the state, OpenAI and Foxconn announced a collaboration to focus on design work and US manufacturing readiness for next-gen AI infrastructure hardware. According to a joint statement from the companies, the rapid advancement of AI necessitates a new class of physical infrastructure.

Energy Storage Solutions cleared a major hurdle in its plan to build a massive 900 MW, 300-acre data center and energy storage campus in eastern North Carolina after county commissioners added data center construction to permitted zoning. Dan Shaffer, president of the Rocky Mount-based company, told Data Center Knowledge that the $19.2 billion project will begin construction in the first quarter of 2026. A twin project is also planned for Fayetteville.

There was a flurry of activity in Virginia as Vantage Data Centers expanded its footprint in the state with a new $2 billion investment. The new 192 MW campus in the Fredericksburg region will bring the company's statewide capacity to 782 MW.

Elsewhere in the Mother of States, CleanArc Data Centers began construction on its flagship campus in Caroline County, Virginia. The new data center campus will provide 900 MW of grid capacity, with the first 300MW available by early 2027.

Lastly, Richmond suburb Powhatan County unanimously approved the development of a new 180-acre data center, according to real estate and investment company JLL, which petitioned the County Board. Dominion Energy plans to power the campus with an initial deployment of 365 MW.

In Atlanta, Microsoft announced what it calls the first AI superfactory, linking multiple facilities within its Fairwater project with hundreds of thousands of advanced GPUs running AI workloads, exabytes of storage, and millions of CPU cores for operational compute tasks.

More North American data center news:

- Microsoft pledged over $60 billion to neocloud data center companies, with about $23 billion of that spending headed to British startup Nscale.

- Google's head of infrastructure, Amin Vahdat, told employees the company must double AI serving capacity every six months to meet intense demand.

- In Kansas City, Missouri, Lambda announced plans to build a 100MW data center in an unoccupied 2009-built facility.

## European Data Center Developments

In Europe, major power outages have led antitrust watchdogs to consider placing new restrictions on Big Tech. The European Commission is investigating the market power of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, which have thus far avoided the full extent of Europe's regulatory laws. If implemented, the tech leaders could see steep penalties.

Coming as the Dutch data center market experiences rapid growth, Digital Realty launched its 12th data center in the Netherlands. AMS11 will add approximately 27 MW of IT capacity across 12,000 sq.m, increasing the company's total capacity in the country to around 159 MW.

In Germany, Google plans to invest €5.5 billion into computing resources and operations over the next four years. That development includes two facilities in the Frankfurt region.

UK-based data center company AtlasEdge will utilize $292 million in sustainability-linked funding to develop two data centers at its new campus in Lisbon, Portugal. The funding, backed by Banco Santander and ING, requires energy efficiency and 100% renewable energy usage.

In Spain, Qilimanjaro Quantum Tech has opened what it claims is Europe's first multimodal quantum-powered data center, preparing to offer cloud-based quantum computing as a service. The facility will house up to 10 quantum computers.

Spanish engineering firm ACS and BlackRock will collaborate on a new data center project with the aim of developing 1.7 GW of capacity. BlackRock agreed to about half of the €2 billion upfront and the other according to milestones, with each company owning 50% of the new venture. Iberdrola and data center developer Echelon Data Centres have partnered on a new company with planned investments of more than €2 billion. The joint venture's first announced project is Madrid Sur, a 160,000 m² campus offering 144 MW of processing capacity with a secured 230 MW electricity connection.

Further north, atNorth has reached an agreement with Vestforbrænding to use excess heat from its DEN01 facility for heating over 8,000 homes in Denmark by 2028. The 22.5 MW site will channel water using Direct Liquid Cooling technology into the district heating network.

The announcement came amid reports that Digital Realty and Equinix were vying to acquire atNorth.

In Norway, a new AI infrastructure startup launched called Fossefall. The company laid out objectives on its LinkedIn page including developing 500 MW of clean AI infrastructure by 2030, generating in-country jobs, and making a positive impact on the environment.

## Asia-Pacific Data Centers Builds

In Asia-Pacific data center news, Malaysia's palm oil companies are setting aside vast tracts of land for new AI data center construction. That land will be needed to house the infrastructure for rapidly growing power demands, with one estimate stating data centers will consume 5GW of electricity in the country by 2035.

In Vietnam, real estate developer Kinh Bac City Development Holding Corporation has signed a memorandum of agreement with Accelerated Infrastructure Capital and VietinBank to jointly develop a 200 MW AI data center project in Ho Chi Minh City.
