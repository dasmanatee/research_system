# Research Documentation Assistant Log

This file tracks actions taken to support the user in writing research documentation. It serves as a reflection and learning log to continuously improve assistance quality.

---

## Learnings & Patterns

### Effective Practices
- Use Grep to search raw_information for topic-specific content before writing
- Present balanced arguments (pro/con structure) when analyzing policy questions
- Include full APA reference list at end of analysis documents
- Cross-reference multiple source files to build comprehensive evidence base

### Areas for Improvement
- Could search for additional European-specific sources beyond current raw_information
- May need more quantitative data for stronger economic arguments

### User Preferences
- Prefers structured format with clear position headings
- Values cited evidence over opinion
- **Research analysis outputs go to 3_user_documents/** (NOT 4_output_documents/)
- Appreciates balanced treatment of both sides of an argument

## Action Log

### [2026-01-11]

**Session Start**
- **Action**: Created this reflection log in 3_user_documents/
- **Purpose**: Establish a persistent record to improve research documentation support
- **Context**: User requested a claude.md file to track actions and enable continuous improvement
- **Outcome**: SUCCESS - File created and ready for ongoing entries

**Observations**:
- The research system has a clear 4-folder structure for organizing work
- Main log.md handles research actions; this file focuses on documentation support learnings
- User values reflection and iterative improvement in assistance

**Next Steps**:
- Document effective strategies as they emerge
- Note user preferences for documentation style, format, and depth
- Track which research-to-documentation workflows work best

### [2026-01-11] - European Data Center Analysis

**Task**: Answer research question from europe_data_center.md
**Approach**:
1. Read user's question file in 3_user_documents/
2. Searched raw_information/ for Europe-related data center content
3. Read 3 primary source files (DCK Dec 2025, DCK 2025 Review, Bisnow predictions)
4. Compiled balanced pro/con analysis with APA citations
5. Output to **3_user_documents/europe_data_center_analysis.md** (corrected destination)

**What worked well**:
- Grep search quickly identified European mentions across files
- Sources contained both investment evidence (pro) and risk factors (con)
- APA format required by styleguide applied correctly

**Reflection**:
- User question format ("defend each position") suggests preference for dialectical analysis
- Industry sources (DCK, Bisnow) provided credible evidence for both sides
- Quantitative data (€5.5B, €2B, etc.) strengthened arguments

**Workflow Correction**:
- Initially output to 4_output_documents/ - WRONG
- User clarified: research analysis documents belong in 3_user_documents/
- 4_output_documents/ is for final publishable outputs (D3.js visualizations, etc.)
- 3_user_documents/ is the working destination for research documentation

## Styleguide

### Citation Requirements

**Format**: APA Style (7th Edition)

All sources in research documentation MUST use APA citation format:

**In-text citations**:
- Single author: (Smith, 2026)
- Two authors: (Smith & Jones, 2026)
- Three or more: (Smith et al., 2026)
- Direct quote: (Smith, 2026, p. 45)
- Web source without page: (Smith, 2026, para. 3)

**Reference list format**:
- Journal: Author, A. A. (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical, volume*(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx
- Book: Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work: Subtitle*. Publisher.
- Website: Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of page. Site Name. https://url
- No date: Use (n.d.)
- No author: Start with title

**Key APA rules to remember**:
- Hanging indent for references
- Italicize titles of longer works (books, journals)
- DOIs preferred over URLs when available
- Include retrieval date only for content that may change

## Reflection Questions (To Answer Over Time)

1. ~~What citation style does the user prefer?~~ **ANSWERED: APA 7th Edition**
2. What documentation formats does the user prefer?
3. Which research sources consistently produce quality content?
4. What level of detail is most useful in summaries?
5. How should raw research be structured before documentation?
6. What tone does the user gravitate toward in their own writing?
7. Are there recurring editorial changes that reveal style preferences?

*This log will grow with each research documentation session.*
